# Decision-Tree-For-Obesity-Diagnosis
A machine learning model based on the Decision Tree algorithm, built entirely from scratch without using the sklearn library, designed to assist in medical diagnosis of obesity.

# üìò Step-by-Step Guide (How to Use the Decision Tree AI Model)

Step 1: Download the dataset file Dataset_500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index.csv to your local machine.

Step 2: Use the pre-written code provided in the Decision_Tree.py file located in the Model directory.

Step 3: Copy the file path to Dataset_500_Person_Gender_Height_Weight_Index.csv (from where you downloaded it on your local machine) and paste it into the read_csv function.

Step 4: Run the program using Visual Studio Code.

Step 5: After a few seconds of training, the model accuracy and a line graph will be displayed in the terminal.

* You can try custom test cases by modifying the input values in the Python code. Change features such as: Gender, Weight, Height to experiment with different patient profiles and see how the model performs in diagnosing obesity.

# Result (k·∫øt qu·∫£):

The model after training reached up to 93% accuracy for the test set.
